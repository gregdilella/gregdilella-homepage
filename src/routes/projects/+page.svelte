			I work in the logistics industry, where I manage and analyze high-volume data generated from daily shipment operations. I'm highly proficient in querying databases and working with big data systems. Beyond data handling, I design and build intelligent algorithms—essentially autonomous agents—on top of databases to extract insights, optimize workflows, and drive operational decisions.
